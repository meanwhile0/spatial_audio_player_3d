## Enums

### RayDistribution

Controls how the omni-directional room-sensing rays are arranged around the emitter.

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `CLASSIC` | 10 predefined rays (cardinal + diagonal + up/down). Fast and predictable. |
| `FIBONACCI_SPHERE` | Evenly distributed rays using a Fibonacci sphere. Better coverage for complex geometry, supports reflections. |
| `SHAPE_SCATTER` | Rays scattered outward from a given collision shape node. Useful for large/irregular emitters. |

### AttenuationFunction

The falloff curve used between the inner radius and the outer boundary.

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `LINEAR` | Volume drops at a constant rate. Simple and predictable. |
| `LOGARITHMIC` | Faster drop-off close to the edge, slower tail. Good for spot sounds. |
| `INVERSE` | Very steep near the source, nearly silent far away. |
| `LOG_REVERSE` | Stays loud across distance, drops dramatically at the far end. |
| `NATURAL_SOUND` | Middle-ground between Logarithmic and Inverse. Closest to real-world behaviour. |
| `USER_DEFINED` | Uses a custom `Curve` resource you provide via `user_attenuation_curve`. |

## Exported Properties

> **Note on `volume_db`:** This property is managed internally by `SpatialAudioPlayer3D`. Editing it directly at runtime has no effect — use `max_db` to control maximum loudness and the attenuation settings below to control falloff.

### Ray Distribution

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ray_distribution` | `RayDistribution` | `CLASSIC` | How room-sensing rays are arranged. |
| `fibonacci_ray_count` | `int` (4–128) | `8` | Number of rays in Fibonacci Sphere mode. More = better accuracy, higher CPU cost. |
| `fibonacci_ray_reflections` | `int` (0–8) | `0` | Reflection bounces per Fibonacci ray (0 = no reflections). Improves estimation in L-shaped rooms or corridors. |
| `scatter_shape` | `Node3D` | `null` | The node used as the scattering origin in Shape Scatter mode. |
| `shape_ray_count` | `int` (1–256) | `32` | Number of rays in Shape Scatter mode. |
| `shape_scatter_randomness` | `int` (0–50) | `0` | How randomly ray directions deviate from the center-to-surface direction. 0 = outward only, 50 = fully random. |
| `max_raycast_distance` | `float` (m) | `50.0` | Maximum distance all raycasts travel. Keep close to `max_distance`. |

### Room Size Reverb

| Property | Type | Default | Description |

## Methods

### `play(from_position: float = 0.0) -> void`

Overrides `AudioStreamPlayer3D.play()`. If `enable_sound_delay` is active, playback is deferred by `distance / speed_of_sound` seconds. Emits `spatial_audio_playback_started` when audio actually begins.

### `play_spatial(from_position: float = 0.0) -> void`

Alias for `play()`. Call this directly if the `play()` override is not dispatched (e.g. the node was instantiated as a plain `AudioStreamPlayer3D`).

### `stop() -> void`

Overrides `AudioStreamPlayer3D.stop()`. Emits `spatial_audio_playback_stopped`.

### `static set_global_effects_disabled(disabled: bool) -> void`

Disables (or re-enables) all spatial audio effects across **every** `SpatialAudioPlayer3D` instance in the scene at once. Useful for a global accessibility option or performance mode.

```gdscript
# Disable all spatial effects globally
SpatialAudioPlayer3D.set_global_effects_disabled(true)
```

### External Integration Methods (Proxy/Navigation)

These are used by external systems such as `SpatialReflectionNavigationAgent3D` to coordinate reflection routing without fighting internal attenuation/occlusion logic.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `set_external_volume_db_offset(offset_db: float) -> void` | Applies extra dB offset on top of internal attenuation. |
| `get_external_volume_db_offset() -> float` | Returns current external dB offset. |
| `clear_external_volume_db_offset() -> void` | Clears external dB offset back to `0.0`. |
| `set_external_occlusion_hold(seconds: float) -> void` | Temporarily holds occlusion open for transition smoothing. |
| `clear_external_occlusion_hold() -> void` | Clears any active external occlusion hold. |
| `is_external_occlusion_held() -> bool` | Returns whether external occlusion hold is currently active. |
| `set_external_navigation_debug_data(active: bool, info: Dictionary = {}) -> void` | Injects navigation/proxy diagnostics for the debug HUD's Navigation dropdown. |
| `clear_external_navigation_debug_data() -> void` | Clears injected external navigation diagnostics. |

## Static Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `global_effects_disabled` | `bool` | When `true`, all instances bypass reverb, occlusion, and air absorption. |

## Inherited properties to be aware of

| Property | Notes |
|---|---|
| `volume_db` | **Managed internally.** Editing directly at runtime has no effect while attenuation is active. |
| `max_db` | Controls the maximum loudness of the stream — this one is yours to set. |
| `unit_size` | The radius at which the sound plays at full volume in Godot's built-in model. Less relevant when `enable_volume_attenuation` is on. |
| `max_distance` | The furthest distance at which the sound is audible. Should equal or exceed `max_raycast_distance`. |
| `bus` | The plugin creates its own child bus automatically — do not change this at runtime. |
